# EggTimer
EggTimer is a basic macOS application - following **Ray Wanderlich's** simple introduction to macOS development. This application allows users to set a timer for boiling eggs, with **5 different** presets as well as an option for custom boiling.

## Purpose
This application is more akin to *practice* than a primary development target - I simply wanted to explore macOS development, especially coming from an iOS background. There is a lot in common, however, the key user interface tools and objects differ significantly. I say so in a positive light - using the **Interface Builder** for macOS UI design is really superb.
